My CS260 Repository

I am excited to learn about web development in this class.

This is a fixed line that I added from GitHub.

Something that I learned from this assignment is that large merge conflicts could potentially be difficult to easily resolve. 
Communication with your team to avoid that would be very useful.

### ELEVATOR PITCH

For my startup project I have decided to create a website that assists users in starting and maintaining good habits. The UI will be simple and intuitive and allow for a daily streak to be tracked or reset if not maintained. It has been said that 21 consistent days of doing something will create a habit, and 90 days of doing something will make it a part of your lifestyle. This web program will allow intuitive tracking that provides a centralized place for new habits to be tracked as you reach for a goal of consistency. Users will be inspired by others on the platform and together they will be able to better their lives.

Key Features
- Creating a new Habit you want to track
- Incrementing or resetting your habit count
- Encouraging other users that are online through a positive notification
- A profile that keeps track of your statistics
