# startup
My CS260 Repository

I am excited to learn about web development in this class.

This is a fixed line that I added from GitHub.

Something that I learned from this assignment is that large merge conflicts could potentially be difficult to easily resolve. 
Communication with your team to avoid that would be very useful.

### ELEVATOR PITCH

For my startup project I have decided to create a website that assists users in starting and maintaining good habits. The UI will be simple and intuitive and allow for a daily streak to be tracked or reset if not maintained. It has been said that 21 consistent days of doing something will create a habit, and 90 days of doing something will make it a part of your lifestyle. This web program will allow intuitive tracking that provides a centralized place for new habits to be tracked as you reach for a goal of consistency. Users will be inspired by others on the platform and together they will be able to better their lives.

Key Features
- Creating a new Habit you want to track
- Incrementing or resetting your habit count
- Encouraging other users that are online through a positive notification
- A profile that keeps track of your statistics

Command to SSH into my server ssh -i ~/Desktop/CS260/Production.pem ubuntu@3.137.42.181

Using the console to debug is very important. I was having issues with my simon project and realized that it was due to the fact that I hadn't connected the .mp3 files to my project which caused an error when they weren't found. I wouldn't have known this had I not used the debugger.


## Midterm Notes
"<div>" creates a division element

A CName DNS record type points you to another DNS record

An A DNS record points directly to an IP address

@import will allow you to pull up a google font using CSS

In promises, there is only a catch if reject is called. Resolve’s parameter is trivial, so even if it is false then it still resolves.

Valid JSON strings look like this {“x”:3}. The Key value needs to have double quotes. Undefined doesn’t work as a value. Null works but not undefined.

.class is the class selector in CSS

#id is the ID selector

p would do all the paragraphs in the sheet

JS needs to be within <script> </script> tags. You can link straight to a source, put a function right inline.

"(/A|f/i)" is anything that has an A in it but i makes it incase sensitive. f/ is anything that starts with an f.

Pals Before Marriage. Content, Padding, Margin, Border. Padding element would put space around the content.

Reduce takes an array and takes it down to one value

Map takes an array and maps it to an array of equal size.

Sum takes the sum of values in an array

Filter filters through an array with a specified filter

"<ul></ul>" makes an unordered list.

"<li></li>" is a list element

Query Selector all would give all elements

Query selector would just give a single element

Use the "<a></a>" tag to create valid hyperlinks

DOM textContent will set the child text for an element.

Subdomains include the main domain but with extra stuff up front.

JS Objects don’t use any equal sign. Just use a colon. JSON objects and JS objects need that. You don’t need quotes around a key in JS objects.

Chmod +x adds the executable tag to a file.

Ssh secure shell

Sudo admin priviledges

Ls -la lists out contents
